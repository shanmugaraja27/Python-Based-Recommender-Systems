# Python-Based-Recommender-Systems
Product Recommendation System for e-commerce businesses
A well developed recommendation system will help businesses improve their shopper's experience on website and result in better customer acquisition and retention.
The python code shared in this repository explores two of the most common approaches to coming up with a recommender list for each shopper.

**Recommendation system part I: Product popularity based system targeted at new customers**: 
This approach is based on finding out the most commonly purchased product in the given database and recommend the ones with the greatest number of purchases. This is a very simple intuitive approach and doesnâ€™t require much coding.

**Recommendation system part II: Model-based collaborative filtering system based on customer's purchase history and ratings provided by other users who bought items similar items**

This approach which is more common in e-commerce websites of today is based on observing co-relations of different product categories derived from customer purchase history and then displaying recommendations of high correlation items to the item already bought by the particular customer.

**Recommendation system part III: When a business is setting up its e-commerce website for the first time without any product rating**
For a business without any user-item purchase history, a search engine based recommendation system can be designed for users. The product recommendations can be based on textual clustering analysis given in product description.
